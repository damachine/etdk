# ETDK - Encrypt-then-Delete-Key

**Makes data powerless** | Secure data deletion through encryption and key destruction.

ETDK implements the official [BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik)](https://www.bsi.bund.de/) recommendation for secure data deletion: **Encrypt data with strong encryption (AES-256-CBC), then securely delete all keys**. This method provides reliable protection against unauthorized recovery — provided the key is actually deleted, not just marked as deleted.

## What It Does

Encrypt → Trash → Gone

**Implements the BSI method: "Daten verschlüsseln und Schlüssel wegwerfen" - Encrypt data and throw away the key**

Encrypts files or entire devices in-place with AES-256-CBC, displays the encryption key once, then permanently wipes the key from RAM. Without the key, the encrypted data is permanently irrecoverable!

## Why This Method?

- **Cryptographically secure**: AES-256, not just pattern overwriting
- **Fast**: Single pass vs. multi-pass wiping (10-20x faster)
- **SSD-safe**: No wear leveling issues
- **Universal**: Works on all storage types

## Core Principles

- **Keep it simple**: POSIX-compliant, minimal dependencies
- **Security first**: Focus on correct implementation of BSI method
- **No bloat**: Reject features that don't serve core mission
- **ETDK follows the Unix philosophy: Do one thing and do it well**

## Use Case

- Selling, gifting, or trading in devices
- Disposing of old hard drives and SSDs
- Irrevocable deletion of sensitive information
- GDPR compliance (Art. 17 - Right to erasure)
- Browser history and cache deletion
- Email archive secure deletion
- Personal documents cleanup

**Browser History & Cache - Secure deletion:**
```bash
# Firefox
sudo etdk ~/.mozilla/firefox/*.default-release/places.sqlite  # History
sudo etdk ~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/                           # Cache

# Chrome/Chromium
sudo etdk ~/.config/google-chrome/Default/History
sudo etdk ~/.cache/google-chrome/

# Safari (macOS)
sudo etdk ~/Library/Safari/History.db
sudo etdk ~/Library/Caches/com.apple.Safari/
```

**Email Archive - Secure deletion:**
```bash
# Thunderbird
sudo etdk ~/.thunderbird/*/Mail/                    # All emails
sudo etdk ~/.thunderbird/*/ImapMail/

# Apple Mail (macOS)
sudo etdk ~/Library/Mail/V10/

# Outlook (Linux with Wine)
sudo etdk ~/.wine/drive_c/users/*/Application\ Data/Microsoft/Outlook/
```

**File Encryption - Selling laptop/PC:**
```bash
# Encrypt all files in Documents folder
find ~/Documents -type f -exec sudo etdk {} \;

# Encrypt specific file types
find ~/Pictures -type f \( -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.png" \) -exec sudo etdk {} \;
```

**File Encryption - GDPR compliance (right to erasure):**
```bash
# Works with any file type: CSV, PDF, databases, etc.
sudo etdk customer_data.csv
sudo etdk invoices.pdf
sudo etdk database.sqlite
rm customer_data.csv invoices.pdf database.sqlite
```

**Device Encryption - Wiping entire drive before sale/disposal:**
```bash
# Examples (requires root):
sudo etdk /dev/sdb        # Entire drive
sudo etdk /dev/sdb1       # Single partition
sudo etdk /dev/nvme0n1    # NVMe drive
```

## Installation

### Linux
```bash
# Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev cmake

# Fedora/RHEL/CentOS
sudo dnf install gcc make openssl-devel cmake

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S base-devel openssl cmake

# Gentoo
sudo emerge dev-libs/openssl dev-util/cmake

# Build and install
make
sudo make install

# Test (optional)
bash test_etdk.sh
```

### macOS
```bash
brew install openssl cmake
make
sudo make install
```

### Windows
```bash
# Install dependencies: Visual Studio, OpenSSL, CMake
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build
cmake --install build
```

### Manual build (all platforms)
```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build

# Linux/macOS (requires sudo for /usr/bin):
sudo cmake --install build

# Windows (no sudo needed):
cmake --install build
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Test first (safe - creates temp file)
bash test_etdk.sh

# Encrypt a file
sudo etdk <file>

# Encrypt a block device (entire drive/partition)
sudo etdk <device>
```
> [!NOTE]
> **You can safely format, delete, reuse, or physically destroy the file/device.**  
> **After encryption, the file/device is gibberish - worthless without the key.**
>
> To complete secure deletion:
> 1. Remove the encrypted file with normal methods (rm).
> 2. Forget the key if you don't need the data.

### Example: File Encryption

```bash
echo "Sensitive data" > secret.txt
sudo etdk secret.txt
```

<details>
  <summary>Output:</summary>

OPERATION SUCCESSFUL

Target:         /dev/sdb1
Status:         ENCRYPTED (AES-256-CBC)
Encryption key: SECURELY WIPED FROM MEMORY

The file/device is now encrypted and permanently unrecoverable - worthless without the key.

To complete secure deletion process:
 1) You can safely remove the encrypted file with normal methods.
 2) Forget the key if you do not need to recover the data.
```
</details>

**What is happened:**
- `secret.txt` was encrypted in-place (same filename, different content)
- `/dev/sdb1` was encrypted in-place (raw sectors overwritten with encrypted data)
- Algorithm: AES-256-CBC with random 256-bit key and 128-bit IV
- Key generation: OpenSSL RAND_bytes() (cryptographically secure)
- Encryption key was displayed on screen (one-time only)
- Key was wiped from RAM with 5-pass method (0x00, 0xFF, random, 0x00, volatile pointers)
- Why 5 passes: RAM has no magnetic remanence (unlike HDDs), random data + volatile pointers = cryptographically secure wipe
- Memory protection: POSIX mlock() prevented key from swapping to disk
- File/Device is now gibberish - can be formatted, reused, or physically destroyed
- Without the key, decryption is equivalent to solving a mathematically hard problem. Current estimates suggest breaking AES-256 would require more energy than exists in the observable universe

## Data Recovery

If you saved the key while it was displayed, decrypt with OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc \
  -K <your_saved_key_hex> \
  -iv <your_saved_iv_hex> \
  -in secret.txt \
  -out secret_recovered.txt
```

**For permanent deletion:** Don't save the key.

> [!CAUTION]
> **CRITICAL: Key Storage Security**
>
> **IF YOU SAVE THE KEY, YOUR DATA IS NOT DELETED - IT'S JUST ENCRYPTED!**
>
> Saving the encryption key defeats the entire purpose of secure data deletion. An attacker who gains access to both the encrypted data AND the saved key can recover everything.
>
> **NEVER do this:**
> - Save key to a text file on the same system
> - Store key in password manager on compromised system
> - Email the key to yourself
> - Save key in cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive, etc.)
> - Write key in a document on the same device
> - Screenshot the key
> - Copy key to clipboard (may be logged)
>
> **Only save the key if:**
> - You need to recover the data later
> - You store it OFFLINE (paper, secure external storage)
> - You store it on a DIFFERENT, TRUSTED system
> - You use proper encryption for key storage (e.g., KeePass on separate device)
>
> **For true secure deletion:** Don't save the key at all - just watch it being displayed, then let ETDK destroy it from memory.
>
> **Remember:** Encrypted data + saved key = NOT DELETED, just encrypted!
>
> - **Never save the key on the same system** you're trying to securely delete data from
> - **Store keys offline** (paper, secure external storage) if recovery is needed
> - **For true secure deletion:** Don't save the key at all - just let it be destroyed

> [!NOTE]
> **Security Notes**
>
> - **File is encrypted in-place** - same filename, encrypted content
> - **Works with files and entire devices** - any file type (text, images, videos, databases, archives) or block device (SSD, HDD, USB drives, partitions)
> - **Key stored in RAM only** - never touches disk, locked with mlock()
> - **Key displayed once** - write it down or lose it forever (3-second pause)
> - **5-pass secure wipe** - key destroyed from RAM (0x00 → 0xFF → random → 0x00 → volatile)
> - **AES-256-CBC** - NIST standard, computationally infeasible to break
> - **BSI compliant** - follows German Federal Office for Information Security recommendations
